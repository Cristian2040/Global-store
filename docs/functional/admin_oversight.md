# ⚖️ Admin Oversight & Platform Control

The Admin dashboard is the "Tower of Control" for the entire platform, providing visibility into every transaction and entity.

## 📈 Platform Analytics
The primary Admin view aggregates real-time data:
-   **Total Users**: Breakdown by role.
-   **Total Revenue**: Aggregated sales across all stores.
-   **Platform Commissions**: Estimated 5% cut (or as configured in System Settings).
-   **Recent Activity Feed**: Live log of new users, stores, and large orders.

## 👥 Entity Management

### 1. User Control
-   Suspend or reactivate any user account.
-   Audit user details and order history.

### 2. Store & Supplier Approvals
-   Review registration requests from new businesses.
-   Enable or disable stores based on compliance.
-   Manage the relationship between Companies and Suppliers.

## ⚙️ System Configuration
Admins manage platform-wide constants:
-   **Tax Rates**: Standard tax percentage for orders.
-   **Commission Rates**: The platform's cut from each store sale.
-   **Support Contacts**: Email and phone for platform support.
-   **Min Order Amounts**: Global minimums for customer transactions.

## 📦 Global Catalog Management
Standardizing product data is critical:
-   Create, Edit, and Delete products in the **Global Catalog**.
-   Ensure metadata (images, categories, barcodes) is consistent for all stores and suppliers.
