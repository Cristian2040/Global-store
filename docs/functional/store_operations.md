# 🏪 Store Operations & Management

Store owners and operators use the dashboard to manage their retail space, inventory levels, and procurement from wholesalers.

## 📦 Inventory Lifecycle

### 1. Catalog Management
Stores don't create products from scratch. They search the **Global Catalog** and link existing products to their store.
-   **Pricing**: Stores define their own `retailPrice`.
-   **Stock Control**: Manual adjustments are possible, but most stock is handled via procurement.

### 2. Procurement (Restocking)
When stock is low, stores use the "Proveedores" section.
-   **Selection**: View different suppliers offering the same global product.
-   **Order Creation**: Select quantities and create a "Restock Order".
-   **Reception**: Once the supplier delivers, the store verifies it using the **Delivery Code**.
-   **Auto-Update**: Confirming delivery automatically increments the Store's inventory for those products.

## 🛒 Sales Fulfillment
Incoming orders from customers appear in the "Pedidos" dashboard.
-   **Process**:
    1.  Review items and availability.
    2.  Mark as "EN PREPARACIÓN".
    3.  Finalize as "LISTA PARA RECOGER" or "EN CAMINO".
-   **Notifications**: Status changes provide feedback to the customer dashboard.

## 📊 Business Insights
The Store Home page provides real-time KPIs:
-   **Total Sales**: Aggregated revenue from delivered orders.
-   **Inventory Value**: Estimated value of current stock.
-   **Low Stock Alerts**: Identifies products that need restocking soon.
